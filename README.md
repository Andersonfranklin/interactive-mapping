### Web Mapping Analysis and Screenshot ###  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the common topics of discussion in Vancouver over the summers that I have been here has been the increasing prevalence of smoke between June and September. The map I created is intended to serve as a possible resource that can explain why smoke is so frequently a part of daily life in Vancouver's summers.   

The following link will take you to my map: https://ubc-geob472-spring2019.github.io/interactive_map.html

The following screenshot shows an interesting part of the data. 2017 (the year in the screenshot) contains some of the largest fires on record in British Columbia. I spent the summer of 2017 in Vancouver and it was noticeably smokier that summer than any other. The screenshot shows why that might've been the case:

## Map Critique Sessions and Collaboration (This section is still in progress)##
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This map would not have been possible without collaborating with my peers both in and out of GEOB 472. My coworkers from this summer were the ones that suggested I try visually hosting this dataset online and they provided me with the data. While I'm not sure this counts as collaboration, online resources such as stack exchange and docs.mapbox.com were invaluable resources for creating this map and helped show me some of the potential ways in which future maps could be enhanced. Within GEOB 472, I was able to receive and hopefully give quality feedback.
