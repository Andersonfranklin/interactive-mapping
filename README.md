### Web Mapping Analysis and Screenshot ###  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the common topics of discussion in Vancouver over the summers that I have been here has been the increasing prevalence of smoke between June and September. The map I created is intended to serve as a possible resource that can explain why smoke is so frequently a part of daily life in Vancouver's summers. The intended audience of this map is people who are curious about the frequency and size of fires in British Columbia and how they have changed over time. Such people may include employees of the BC Forest Service who may use the information to better distribute fire fighting resources as well as journalists and scientists who want to consider how fires may become more of a risk for people in BC and elsewhere as the global climate increases in variability. In short, this map aims to answer the question: "are fires increasing in size and frequency in British Columbia?" This map is successful at allowing the user to see for themselves how there is considerable variability between fire seasons, but that a clear positive trend exists.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the design of this map, I wanted to ensure that users were only given the information that was relevant to this project. As such, I chose the mapbox 'dark' style and elected to remove most of the non-essential information such as the hillshade and other POIs. However, I decided to keep some polygons like the national parks and landcover as they give a good indication of what might be threatened by each fire. For the fire polygons, I chose to have a linear scaling color scheme of yellow to red. I chose these colors as they are frequently used to represent dangerous or hazardous features in western society.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interactivity is a central to this map's ability to convey information. The time slider allows users to see fires from each year individually which is critical to successfully answer the question this map addresses. While the Canadian National Fire Database provides the dataset necessary for creating this map, it is not possible to see how fires change spatially and temporally without adding the interactivity of a time slider. However, the time slider could have been more successful if additional filters were implemented that would allow users to see fires over periods lasting longer than one year (ex. fires in the 10 year period between 2008-2017).

The following screenshot shows an interesting part of the data. 2017 (the year in the screenshot) contains some of the largest fires on record in British Columbia. I spent the summer of 2017 in Vancouver and it was noticeably smokier that summer than any other. The screenshot shows why that might've been the case:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resources for this map include the slides from GEOB 472 given on February 7th, 2019 as well as a mapbox gl js tutorial found here: https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/timeline-animation/. Andrew Butt was an additional source of help for this project. I initially planned to create this map using leaflet js but later decided to use Mapbox. As a result, the help he provided me in attempting to create the leaflet version of this map was not used, but the cartographic suggestions he made were included.
